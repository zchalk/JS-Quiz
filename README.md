# JS-Quiz

## My Task

This was easily our hardest assignment yet. For this week I was supposed to create an interactive quiz that was timed, kept score, could store scores, and could show high scores. If I could do this activity over again differently, I would. I think I should've used JavaScript to create more items and not utilize so many different HTML pages (although this may be necessary with larger applications to increase speed and efficiency.) This, like I said, has been a difficult assignment during a week I fell behind. Still my quiz is fully functional! These were my parameters:

## User Story

```
AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and my score
```
